# Java Practice - 2023

This repository contains my daily Java practice code for the year 2023.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to document my journey of learning and improving my Java programming skills through
daily practice. By committing my code to GitHub, I can track my progress, review my past work, and share my learning experience with others.

## Directory Structure
The repository is organized by month, with each month having its own directory. Within each monthly directory, the daily 
practice code is stored in individual files, named with the date (e.g., `2023-05-25.java`).
